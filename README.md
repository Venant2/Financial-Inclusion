## Financial Inclusion in East Africa: A Machine Learning Exploration

This project delves into the factors influencing access to bank accounts in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to shed light on the financial inclusion landscape in East Africa.

**Project Goals:**

* Analyze a comprehensive dataset encompassing demographics, economic activity, mobile phone usage, and financial transaction history.
* Explore relationships between these features and bank account ownership.
* Build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of individuals having a bank account.
* Identify key drivers of financial inclusion in the region.

**Data and Methodology:**

* The dataset encompasses various features related to individuals' socio-economic background, financial behavior, and access to technology.
* Data cleaning and preprocessing are performed to ensure data quality and prepare it for machine learning algorithms.
* Categorical features are encoded using appropriate techniques (e.g., one-hot encoding).
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to visualize feature distributions, identify patterns, and understand relationships with the target variable (bank account ownership).
* Machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) are trained and evaluated to predict bank account access.

**Potential Applications:**

* Insights from this project can inform strategies for promoting financial inclusion in East Africa. 
* The findings can be valuable for policymakers, financial institutions, and NGOs working to expand access to financial services.

**Getting Started:**

This repository includes the following:

* Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
* Scripts for data preprocessing and encoding.
* Documentation and comments within the code for better understanding.

**Feel free to:**

* Explore the code and notebooks.
* Run the analysis and experiment with different machine learning models.
* Contribute to the project by suggesting improvements or adding new functionalities.

**Note:** This project is ongoing. Future work may involve:

* Fine-tuning the machine learning model for better performance.
* Analyzing the model's interpretability to understand the key factors influencing predictions.
* Exploring alternative encoding techniques or feature engineering approaches.

I welcome your feedback and contributions to this project!
